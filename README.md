# MPPT-controller-for-heating-water-from-photovoltaic.
Maximum power point tracking controller for heating water from PV based on Stm32 and synchronus Buck converter.

MPPT stands for Maxium Power Point Tracking, you need it when you want to use maximum available power from your photovoltaic.
I made one for heating water in my house, you can use it everywhere the circuit is totaly OFF-GRID everything you need is 
- Photovoltaic panels
- Controller
- the simplest resistance heater (it can be 2000W, 500W... the controller doesn't care about it)

PCB has been designed in KiCad and manufactered in JLCPCB
